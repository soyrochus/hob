# Hob

**Hob** CHANGE HERE!!!

[A **hob** is a small, mythological household spirit from English folklore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hob_(folklore)), known for helping with chores—unless offended, in which case they become a nuisance. Similarly, Hob the app is your friendly, AI-powered assistant, organizing and managing your project notes and files. Treat it well, and it’ll work wonders; ignore it, and your tasks might just pile up!
